//ButtonLogic -

//When button + is pushed - the product should be added to cart. 

//When button CART is pushed - You should go to checkout

//When button TA BORT is pushed - You will remove one item

//When button LÄGG TILL is pushed - You will add one of the same item

// When button Swish is pushed - You will get something that says "You have paid" and then removes everything from cart and goes to first page. 


//Might need a button GÅ TILLBAKA - to go from checkout to mainpage.
